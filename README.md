<summary>ðŸ§  <strong>Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD): Esketamine vs. Ketamine</strong></summary>

### Esketamine (SpravatoÂ®) vs. Ketamine (IV Infusion)

> **Condition Context:** Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) affects patients who have not responded to at least two different antidepressant trials. In the U.S., this represents an estimated **30-40%** of the general MDD population.

#### ðŸ’° Cost Comparison (United States)

| Therapy | Details | Induction Cost (USD) | Estimated Annual Cost (USD)* |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| **Esketamine** | `SpravatoÂ®` nasal spray | ~ $4,720 â€“ $7,080 | **~$20,000 â€“ $30,000** |
| **Ketamine** | Racemic, IV Infusion (Cash-pay) | ~ $2,100 â€“ $6,000 | **~$5,600 â€“ $16,000** |

*<small>Note: Annual cost is estimated based on a standard treatment protocol, including an initial induction phase followed by a full year of maintenance sessions (approx. 34 sessions/year for SpravatoÂ® and 16 sessions/year for IV Ketamine).</small>*
