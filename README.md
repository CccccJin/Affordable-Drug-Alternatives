<summary> ü¶† <strong> COVID-19: Molnupiravir vs. Fluvoxamine</strong></summary>

### Molnupiravir (Lagevrio¬Æ) vs. Fluvoxamine

* **Molnupiravir Brand:** `Lagevrio¬Æ`
* **Fluvoxamine Brands:** Primarily available as a generic drug. A common brand name is `Luvox¬Æ`.

> **Condition Context:** These oral medications are used for the early treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adults who are at high risk for progression to severe disease. The goal is to prevent hospitalization and death.

#### üí∞ Cost per Treatment Course Comparison (All Figures in USD)

| Drug | Region | Estimated Cost per Course (USD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Molnupiravir**<br>(Lagevrio¬Æ) | **United States** | `~$700` | Based on initial US government procurement price. |
| | **United Kingdom/EU** | `~$300 - $500` | Price reflects national negotiations and procurements. |
| | **LMICs (via MPP)** | `~$20 - $40` | Generic versions available via the Medicines Patent Pool license. |
| **Fluvoxamine**<br>(Generic) | **Global** | `~$10 - $30` | Mature, widely available generic drug.<br>Used off-label for COVID-19. |

<summary>üß¨ <strong>Cushing's Disease: Korlym vs. Mifepristone</strong></summary>

### Korlym (mifepristone) vs. Generic Mifepristone

* **Korlym¬Æ Brand:** A specialty, high-cost formulation of `mifepristone`.
* **Generic Mifepristone:** The same active ingredient, widely known for its use in medical abortion (`Mifeprex¬Æ` was the original brand), and available as a low-cost generic.

> **Condition Context:** Cushing's disease is a rare endocrine disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone cortisol. Korlym is specifically approved to control hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in adult patients with Cushing's who are not candidates for surgery or have failed prior surgery.

#### üí∞ Annual Cost Comparison (United States)

| Therapy | Details | Estimated Annual Cost (USD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Korlym¬Æ** | Specialty brand for Cushing's | **`~$200,000 - $500,000+`** | An ultra-orphan drug with extremely high pricing, dependent on dosing. |
| **Mifepristone** | Generic version | **`~$3,000 - $10,000`** | Cost is for daily, off-label use for Cushing's, calculated from the low price of generic tablets. A stark contrast to the branded version. |

<summary>‚öïÔ∏è <strong>Nephropathic Cystinosis: Procysbi vs. Cystagon</strong></summary>

### Procysbi (cysteamine) vs. Cystagon (cysteamine)

* **Active Ingredient:** Both drugs are different formulations of `cysteamine bitartrate`.
* **Key Difference:** `Procysbi¬Æ` is a delayed-release formulation dosed every 12 hours. `Cystagon¬Æ` is an older, immediate-release formulation dosed every 6 hours.

> **Condition Context:** Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder where the amino acid cystine accumulates in cells, causing widespread tissue and organ damage, particularly to the kidneys and eyes. Cysteamine therapy helps to deplete these toxic cystine levels.

#### üí∞ Annual Cost Comparison (United States)

| Therapy | Details | Estimated Annual Cost (USD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **Procysbi¬Æ** | Delayed-Release (12-hr dosing) | **`~$300,000 - $900,000+`** | Priced at a significant premium for the quality-of-life benefit of not requiring middle-of-the-night dosing. Cost is highly weight-dependent. |
| **Cystagon¬Æ** | Immediate-Release (6-hr dosing) | **`~$50,000 - $150,000`** | The older standard of care. While still expensive as an orphan drug, it is far less costly than the newer formulation. |

<summary>üî¨ <strong>MS & Rheumatic Disorders: H.P. Acthar Gel vs. Corticosteroids</strong></summary>

### H.P. Acthar¬Æ Gel (ACTH) vs. Synthetic Corticosteroids

* **H.P. Acthar¬Æ Gel:** A purified preparation of `adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)`, a biologic with a controversial pricing history.
* **Corticosteroids:** Generic, synthetic steroid hormones like `prednisone` (oral) or `methylprednisolone` (IV).

> **Condition Context:** Both are used to treat acute exacerbations (flares or relapses) in MS and some rheumatic disorders by powerfully reducing inflammation. Synthetic corticosteroids are the standard first-line therapy. Acthar Gel is typically reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to high-dose steroids.

#### üí∞ Cost per Treatment Course Comparison (All Figures in USD)

| Therapy | Details | Estimated Cost per Course (USD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| **H.P. Acthar¬Æ Gel** | ACTH biologic | **`~$45,000 - $200,000+`** | One of the most expensive drugs in the US by vial cost (~$45k). A full course of treatment is extremely costly. |
| **Corticosteroids** | Generic (e.g., IV Solu-Medrol) | **`~$500 - $2,000`** | Includes the cost of the generic drug and infusion services. Represents the inexpensive standard of care. |
